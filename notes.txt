create project 

add port and view entry in application.prop file 


spring -->  spring web --> webapp 

controller --> logic --> 
input / output --> jsp 


spring -> you can not access jsp directly. 
		 we create jsp inside WEB-INF/views  

if we want to access jsp , we can access via url[servlet] 



if we have spring starter / boot project , we don't have support lib for jsp , 
to support jsp in boot project we have to add 1 jar file in pom.xml
